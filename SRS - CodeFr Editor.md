- **Write and Edit**: CodeFr code snippets.
- **Run**: Code snippets in a safe environment using Docker containerization.
- **Save and View**: Past code snippets.
- **Delete**: Unwanted code snippets.
- **Participate in Community**:
  - Post coding challenges.
  - Submit solutions.
  - Test solutions and share feedback.
- **Engage Socially**:
  - Like, share, and comment on code snippets.
  - Share snippets on social media platforms.

### **Target Audience**

The IDE targets developers familiar with or interested in learning the CodeFr programming language:

- **Beginner Developers**: The platform should be user-friendly and provide a smooth learning experience.
- **Experienced Developers**: The IDE should offer features to facilitate efficient coding workflows.
